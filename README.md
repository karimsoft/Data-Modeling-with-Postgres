## Introduction

A startup called Sparkify wants to analyze the data they've been collecting on
songs and user activity on their new music streaming app. The analytics team is
particularly interested in understanding what songs users are listening to.
Currently, they don't have an easy way to query their data, which resides in a
**directory of JSON logs** on user activity on the app, as well as a **directory
with JSON metadata** on the songs in their app.

They need a data engineer to create a **Postgres** database with tables designed
to **optimize queries on song play analysis.** Our role is to create a **database
schema** and **ETL pipeline** for this analysis. Then we'll test our database and ETL
pipeline by running queries given by the analytics team from Sparkify and
compare our results with their expected results.

## Description

In this project, We'll apply the concepts learned in data modeling with Postgres
and build an ETL pipeline using Python. We will define **fact and dimension tables**
for a star schema for a particular analytic focus, and write an ETL pipeline
that transfers data from files in two local directories into these tables in
Postgres using **Python** and **SQL.**

## Data

<a id="song"></a>

### Song Dataset

The first dataset is a subset of real data from the [Million Song
Dataset](https://labrosa.ee.columbia.edu/millionsong/). Each file is in JSON
format and contains metadata about a song and the artist of that song. The files
are **partitioned by the first three letters** of each song's track ID. For example,
here are filepaths to two files in this dataset.

<pre>
data/song_data/A/B/C/TRABCEI128F424C983.json
data/song_data/A/A/B/TRAABJL12903CDCF1A.json
</pre>

And below is an example of what a single song file, _TRAABJL12903CDCF1A.json_,
looks like.

<pre>
{"num_songs": 1, "artist_id": "ARJIE2Y1187B994AB7", "artist_latitude": null, "artist_longitude": null, "artist_location": "", "artist_name": "Line Renaud", "song_id": "SOUPIRU12A6D4FA1E1", "title": "Der Kleine Dompfaff", "duration": 152.92036, "year": 0}
</pre>

<a id="log_data"></a>

### Log Dataset

The second dataset consists of log files in JSON format generated by this [event
simulator](https://github.com/Interana/eventsim) based on the songs in the
dataset above. These simulate app activity logs from a music streaming app based
on specified configurations.

The log files in the dataset we'll be working with are **partitioned by year and
month.** For example, here are filepaths to two files in this dataset.

<pre>
data/log_data/2018/11/2018-11-12-events.json
data/log_data/2018/11/2018-11-13-events.json
</pre>

And below is an example of what the data in a log file, _2018-11-12-events.json_,
looks like.

![log-data](./img/log-data.png)

If you would like to look at the json data within log_data files, you will need to create a Pandas df to read the data. Remember to first import _json_ and _pandas_ libraries.

```python
df = pd.read_json(filepath, lines=True)
```

> Note: Make sure to set `lines= True` so that each line of the JSON file is read as a new row.

For e.g., `df = pd.read_json('data/log_data/2018/11/2018-11-01-events.json', lines=True)` would read the data file _2018-11-01-events.json_

Here is a helpful [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hO2CayzZBoA) from **Udacity's Data Wrangling course** talking about the JSON files format.

## Schema for Song Play Analysis

Using the song and log datasets, we'll create a star schema optimized for queries
on song play analysis. This includes the following tables.

<a id="fact"></a>

### Fact Table

1. **songplays** - records in log data associated with song plays, i.e., records with
  page `NextSong`
    - *songplay_id, time_id, user_id, level, song_id, artist_id, session_id,
      location, user_agent*

<a id="dim"></a>

### Dimension Tables

2. **users** - Following information about users:
    - *user_id, first_name, last_name, gender, level*

3. **songs** - Following info about songs:
    - *song_id, title, artist_id, year, duration*

4. **artists** - Artists information:
    - *artist_id, name, location, latitude, longitude*

5. **time** - timestamps of records in **songplays** broken down into specific units
    - *time_id,start_time, hour, day, week, month, year, weekday*

In order to create these tables, all we need to do is perform some transformation in the data which are already in song_data and log_data directory.

<a id='p_song'></a>

## Process Song Data

We will perform ETL on the files in *song_data* directory to create two dimensional tables: `songs` table and `artists` table.

Variables *song_table_insert* and *artist_table_insert* are SQL queries. These are given in sql_queries.py file.

<a id='p_log'></a>

## Process Log Data

We will perform ETL on the files in *log_data* directory to create the remaining two dimensional tables: `time` and `users`, as well as the `songplays` fact table.
 
<a id="files"></a>

## Files
 
   ** create_tables.py** to initialize postgres tables, replacing any that already exist.
  **  sql_queries.py** contains the sql queries used for creating, reading, inserting, and deleting.
   ** etl.py or etl.ipynb ** to extract transform and load data from song and log data to the tables: songs, users, artists, times, and songplays.
    **test.ipynb** Test load data
    **/data** contains the data for both the song data and the log data.

## Software Requirements

This project requires Python 3.6.x and the necessary libraries are mentioned in _requirements.txt._

## Conclusion
**We are work with Star Schema **

We created a Postgres database from the two JSON directories. We extracted data from two directories, applied transformation, filtering, and then inserting the transformed data into appropriate tables.

The purpose of this database is to store data in a star schema. We have the songplays fact table with several dimension tables: songs, users, artists, and times. Each dimension table has a primary key that corresponds to a foreign key in the songplays fact table.

Songplays change very frequently as different users play new songs, but the other information such as song and artist information are don't change. We use postgres as our data store since we're working with managable data sizes and want OLTP (since we're just logging data into tables). Any time we need to add songs, artists, or users, we just need to do an insert with very little data duplication.
